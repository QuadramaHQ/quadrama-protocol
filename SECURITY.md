# Security Policy

## Scope
Quadrama is a live end-to-end encrypted messaging service with real users.

This repository contains documentation, protocol notes, and threat modeling
only. It does NOT contain production infrastructure, credentials,
or full source code.

Only the materials explicitly present in this repository are in scope
for review and discussion.

## Authorized Testing
No testing, probing, scanning, fuzzing, exploitation attempts, or
traffic analysis against live systems, servers, networks, or user
accounts is authorized by this repository.

Any security testing against production systems requires explicit
written permission from the Quadrama team.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you believe you have discovered a security issue related to Quadrama,
please report it responsibly:

- Email: security@quadrama.ch
- Please do NOT open public GitHub issues for sensitive vulnerabilities.
- Include clear reproduction steps, affected components, and
  potential impact where possible.

## Disclosure Process
We aim to acknowledge reports within a reasonable time frame and
will coordinate responsible disclosure with the reporter.

Public disclosure without prior coordination may put users at risk
and is strongly discouraged.

## Legal
Unauthorized testing of live systems may be illegal in many jurisdictions.
Nothing in this repository grants permission to bypass safeguards,
reverse engineer protected systems, or attempt exploitation.
